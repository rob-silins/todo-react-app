<h2>My first actual deployed React app project</h2>

<p>I'm fully aware that this is not as good as it could be. </p>
<p>If I'm going to return to this project, one thing I will fix it to make it mobile friendly.</p>
<p>The project has been deployed <a href='https://myfirstreactapp.com/' target="blank"> here </a>.</p>
<p>Simply click the About link to read about it in details and then try it out for yourself! Thanks! </p>
